# online_program_toolkit

This toolkit is under heavy design and development. The goal is to create an easy to follow visual guide and worksheets to help faculty design an online learning program with instructional design methodologies and theory baked in. This will help alleviate gaps in instructional knowledge for those new to designing online courses or teaching in general.
